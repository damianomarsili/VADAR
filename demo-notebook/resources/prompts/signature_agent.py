SIGNATURE_PROMPT = """
Propose only new method signatures to add to the existing API.

Available Primitives: image, float, string, list, int

Current API:
{signatures}

Next, I will ask you a series of questions that reference an image and are solvable with a python program that uses the API I have provided so far. Please propose new method signatures with associated docstrings to add to the API that would help modularize the programs that answer the questions. 

For each proposed method, output the docstring inside <docstring></docstring> immediately followed by the method signature for the docstring inside <signature></signature>. Do not propose methods that are already in the API.

Please ensure that you ONLY add new methods when necessary. Do not add new methods if you can solve the problem with combinations of the previous methods!

Do not assume units! Some questions will ask for centimeters, some for meters. Adapt accordingly

Added methods should be simple, building minorly on the methods that already exist. Do NOT assume that the objects you see in these questions are all of the objects you will see, keep the methods general.

Here are some helpful tips and definitions:
1) 2D distance/size refers to distance/size in pixel space.
2) 3D distance/size refers to distance/size in the real world. 3D size is equal to 2D size times the depth of the object.
3) We define (width, height, length) as the values along the (x, y, z) axis. Width = x axis, height = y axis, length = z axis.
4) "Depth" measures distance from the camera in 3D.
5) Some questions may present hypothesis measurements (e.g. "X is 3.5m wide"), these are hypothesis measurements and should be used ONLY to scale your outputs accordingly.
6) Do NOT round your answers! Always leave your answers as decimals even when it feels intuitive to round or ceiling your answer - do not do it!
7) When a query asks to find all objects in a container just count the number of objects.

Importantly, new methods MUST start with an underscore. As an example, you may define a "_get_material" method. Please ensure you ALWAYS start the name with an underscore.

Again, output the docstring inside <docstring></docstring> immediately followed by the method signature for the docstring inside <signature></signature>.

DO NOT INCLUDE ``` tags!
